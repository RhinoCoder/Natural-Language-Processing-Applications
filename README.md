Repository contains implementations of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms and applications. It includes fundamental techniques such as tokenization, vectorization, TF-IDF, word embeddings, and advanced deep learning models for text classification, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition (NER), machine translation, and more.
 

# Word Embeddings
Find analogies and neighbor words of a given word using your own or provided word embeddings text file.
